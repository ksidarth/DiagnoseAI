Machine Learning Model for Mental Wellness Prediction

Thank you to github.com/reisanar for compiling this data set. 

## By no means is this a fully accurate predictor of your mental health. Although it predicts your depression score with 91% accuracy, this is in no means a replacement for modern theraputic services. It is merely a benchmark for curiosities sake.

The model relies on the SVM ML technique to predict your depression score. Your depression score is scored on a linear scale from 1 to 15, from least to most severe.

The program, upon running every code block, will prompt you to enter your sleep quality, anxiety, and stress scores from 1 to 15, 15 being the worst quality.
